# Twilio-bot

I have created this project using Twilio(A cloud communication service),Ngrok and flask.Before starting the project,we have to create a virtual environment.With the help of twilio we create a sandbox (for testing our bot).Twilio provides us a number and a phrase through which we can register our whatsapp number.Ngrok converts our local url to public url.Now all we have to do is to configure our sandbox through this url and then we are ready to use the bot. We can deploy this on any application (such as Heroku) so that our bot works even when our PC/laptop is closed.We can use Dialogbox and its agents to create a perfect conversational bot.
